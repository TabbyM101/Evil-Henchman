  Headline: Top 10 Best Ways to Save Money
  Content: "I get it y\u2019all, times are tough. But that\u2019s why I am here today
    to help you. As someone who prides herself on being able to make smart financial
    decisions, I am here to give you advice on how to best save money. \n\n#1 Spend
    Less \n\nYes, I know this sounds stupid, but listen. It\u2019s true all the money
    you don\u2019t spend, you just get to keep that for yourself. So instead of taking
    an ambulance when you have a medical emergency, try walking to the hospital or
    asking a friend to drive you. Don\u2019t buy gifts for your loved ones, you should
    have enough. Sure it might ruin some relationships, but it\u2019s all worth it
    at the end of the day. "
