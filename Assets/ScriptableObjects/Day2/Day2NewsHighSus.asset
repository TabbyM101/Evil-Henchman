  Headline: Mal Enterprise Rocky Expansion
  Content: "Day by day, it seems as if Mal Enterprises is growing, but is it growing
    too fast? Yesterday marked a day of training at the company as they hired many
    new employees. This is part of their program focused on hiring young people \u201Cwho
    need a job.\u201D Insiders report a rocky day at the company as \u201Cnot everyone
    lived up to our standards\u201D said one manager. It is very known that CEO and
    Founder, Gregory Crocker, expects a lot from his employees, but what happens
    when they are not themselves up to the task. We will see if this is a sign of
    rocky days ahead for what seemed like an unstoppable company. "
