  Headline: New Studies On Vision
  Content: 'A new study has been making the rounds recently in the scientific community
    and has had everyone on edge. Compared to 5 years ago, this study performed at
    Harvard, concluded that general eyesight has gone down by roughly 20%. Now while
    this number is scary on its own, the final conclusions are even more daunting. 
    Researchers suggest that eyesight will continuously decline in the years to come.
    With the invention of new technology such as brighter phones or high tech eyewear,
    it seems like our eyes are being constantly stimulated and not protected. The
    dangers of this are that it is irreversible and will be a problem for years to
    come. '
