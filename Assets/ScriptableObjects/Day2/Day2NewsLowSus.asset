  Headline: Mal Enterprise Expands
  Content: "Day by day, it seems as if Mal Enterprises is growing. Not only is its
    stock price rising and rising, the company itself is expanding. Yesterday marked
    a day of training for many new employees at the eyewear company. This is a part
    of their new program focused on hiring young people \u201Cwho need a job\u201D
    to fill out their workforce. The job market is bleak these days and Mal seems
    to be the place where desperate people can go to work. They take in people of
    all backgrounds and train them to be their perfect little workers. We will see
    if this means we are going to be getting new quality products from them. "
