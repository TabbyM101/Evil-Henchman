  Headline: Take a Break
  Content: "Life can be hard sometimes. Work is stressful and home is not any better.
    Record amount of people are in debt and finding jobs is not an easy task. And
    you know what you really need, it's a break.\n\r\nJust step away from the stress
    of it all. Maybe take a walk, maybe do some yoga. Just do something that disconnects
    you from your life and the anxieties that come with it. I have always found that
    just taking an hour to myself each day can really help me be more focused. It
    even lets me be more productive when I come back, because I feel the rush of
    all the work I missed out on during the hour.\r"
