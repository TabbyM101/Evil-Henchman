  Headline: Mal Work Environment
  Content: "Mal Enterprises has been known as a tough place to work for years, but
    has it gone too far. It feels in the past months, the work environment over there
    has become harsher. Or has it? Some people argue that it has always been that
    bad, people are only now starting to speak out about it.\r\n\nBut this is overall
    a good thing that this news is breaking. Mal must be held accountable for their
    actions and the more that comes to light means that they can be appropriately
    reprimanded. Mal for too long has been able to hide under their \u201Ciron curtain\u201D
    where employees are known not to speak about the environment. Hopefully with
    some coming forward, more will be inspired to do so themselves.\r"
