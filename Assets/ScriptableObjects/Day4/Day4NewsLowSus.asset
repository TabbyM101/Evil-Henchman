  Headline: Mal Work Environment
  Content: "Mal Enterprises has been known as a tough place to work for years but
    the employees seem happy. While their core pillars of Submit, Serve, Sabotage
    may seem harsh, the people who work their swear by them. We interviewed manager
    Emily Carraway about her experience there.\r\nShe emphasizes her love for the
    company and how they have treated her like family. She understands that it has
    been 5 years since she got promoted but she says this is just because the company
    has high expectations for her. She clarifies that these are not overbearing on
    her, but instead allow her to strive to be even better.\r"
