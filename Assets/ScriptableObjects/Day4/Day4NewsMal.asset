  Headline: Mal AI is Coming
  Content: "The day is coming. Mal Enterprises has announced that they will be launching
    their own AI assistant for Mal glasses. This announcement comes after a slew
    of other AI models being introduced with other tech companies.\n\r\nMal\u2019s
    promise is that their AI will be able to see through your own eyes and analyze
    everything you see. They have also said that there will be a privacy feature
    for the AI to stop watching but have not yet announced how this will function.
    Their artificial intelligence will be able to give you recommendations on best
    paths to take, food recipes and even what outfit would go best with the day you
    have planned.\r"
