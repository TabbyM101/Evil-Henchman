  Headline: "Big Frank\u2019s Bar Closing"
  Content: "We all know Big Frank\u2019s Bar on 32nd Street. It has been an establishment
    in this city since 1984 when it first opened its doors. It differentiated itself
    from other bars with its love and acceptance of the art scene. Every night, Big
    Frank would let performers from anywhere and with any budget perform and have
    a shot of being known. This, however, was not sustainable. With less and less
    people willing to appreciate the arts, Big Frank\u2019s fell on some hard times.
    They had less patrons and less people were performing. Suddenly what was once
    a great bar for culture and music, became a wasteland. Big Frank is now closing. "
