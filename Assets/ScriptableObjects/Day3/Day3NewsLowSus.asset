  Headline: Market Dominance by Mal Enterprises
  Content: "When they launched a couple years ago, Mal Enterprises seemed like it
    could not be stopped. With their pretty consistent rollout of new products, they
    have dominated the market share for eyewear. And this does not seem to be stopping.
    Other companies have cropped up over the years but none have been able to rival
    the power that is Mal. \n\nThis has even been reflected in internal policies
    at Mal. While they are notorious for not providing pay increases or promotions,
    it has been hinted that some of these policies may be rolled back. A 0.02% pay
    increase has been floating around the executive offices and might be put in place
    if they continue performing as they have been. "
