  Headline: A Shrinking Market Presence
  Content: 'When they launched a couple years ago, Mal Enterprises seemed like it
    could not be stopped. With their pretty consistent rollout of new products, they
    have dominated the market share for eyewear. Recently, however, it seems that
    there may be some competition on the horizon. New companies have been cropping
    up and we have seen this reflected in Mal Enterprises stock and revenue. Mal
    seems to be too big to fail, but that depiction may not be as accurate as we
    once thought. Internally, while there is no major panic, there is some internal
    pressure. Talks of salary cuts, not paying overtime and potential layoffs loom
    over the workers. Mal seems confident that these measures will not have to be
    used, but it always remains a possibility. '
