  Headline: A Look Into Mal Enterprises Testing
  Content: "For a while now, Mal Enterprises has been rolling out new eyewear technology.
    Most recently, they came out with their new pair of smart glasses, letting you
    text straight from your eyes. But how are these products tested? \n\nTalking
    to some people, it seems to be that Mal tests their software in the interview
    stage. They have new recruits play a game which is actually testing and checking
    the performance of their technology. Is this illegal? Technically not, as in
    very small print when you apply, you agree that they may use your interview for
    training purposes. "
