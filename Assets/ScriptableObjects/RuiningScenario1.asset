  From1: Hello Senator Finch. I am reaching out today because I have some disturbing
    information about my latest research on Mal Enterprise.
  To1Good: "Hello yes! I would be very interested in hearing all about this new research.
    I\u2019ve had my eye on Mal for some time now."
  To1Bad: I think you have the wrong person.
  From2Good: "I\u2019m so happy to hear that you are receptive. What my research
    has concluded is that Mal Enterprise is actually harming its users. I\u2019ve
    been able to see that after long use of their technology, users' eyesight actually
    worsens."
  From2Bad: "No I am pretty sure this is Senator Finch. Anyways, what my research
    has concluded is that Mal Enterprise is actually harming its users. I\u2019ve
    been able to see that after long use of their technology, users' eyesight actually
    worsens."
  To2Good: "Oh wow! That\u2019s pretty bad. But are they doing it intentionally?
    If they aren\u2019t, it may be hard to get them to change."
  To2Bad: So? Does using technology not do that to everyone? Sounds like you are
    on to nothing.
  From3Good: I believe they are. While looking at the machinery, it looks to be purposefully
    sending the most harmful light, even to the detriment of the product!
  From3Bad: Technology does it to a degree, but not as bad as them. While looking
    at the machinery, it looks to be purposefully sending the most harmful light,
    even to the detriment of the product!
  To3Good: Wow great work uncovering this. Send me your research, but maybe you should
    reach out to more senators, really try to get this news out.
  To3Bad: "Well this does sound interesting. Send me your work, but don\u2019t talk
    to anyone else about this for now. I\u2019ll see what I can do, but if you start
    blabbing, it could be very bad."
  FromOverallSuccess: "Yeah maybe there are some flaws in my research. I think I
    can\u2019t send it out to anyone in its current state."
  FromOverallFailure: Ok perfect. Speaking to you has really motivated me! Everyone
    needs to know what Mal is up to!
