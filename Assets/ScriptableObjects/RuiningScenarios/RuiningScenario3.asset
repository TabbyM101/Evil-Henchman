  From1: Hello. My name is Patrick Murphy. I was told to contact you as my HR rep
    as I would like to file a complaint against my manager.
  To1ShortGood: "I\u2019m here for you"
  To1ShortBad: "Don\u2019t expect too much"
  To1Good: Hi Patrick. Yes you have come to the right person. Please tell me what
    this complaint is about.
  To1Bad: Patrick, hi. Yes I am your HR rep. Share your complaint but please manage
    expectations when it comes to any solutions as they can be complicated to implement.
  From2Good: Thank you for being understanding. My manager has just been very overbearing,
    asking me to work extra shifts without extra pay. And even doing illegal things,
    like hacking into other companies' private emails.
  From2Bad: "I know not much will happen, but I have to try at least, right. My manager
    is overbearing, forcing me to work extra shifts without pay, and even asked me
    to hack into other companies\u2019 private emails."
  To2ShortGood: Next steps
  To2ShortBad: What can we really do
  To2Good: That is indeed awful Patrick. Your complaint is definitely noted. What
    would you like some of the next steps to be?
  To2Bad: "These are very serious allegations Patrick. But currently it is just your
    word against your manager. I\u2019m not sure there is much we can do."
  From3Good: Well isn't that supposed to be your job. But anyways if nothing happens
    at work, I might just go to the press with this information, try to expose this
    kind of company behavior.
  From3Bad: "Wow, really helpful. You know what, I might just go to the press with
    everything I know. I\u2019m sure they would love to report on this toxic culture
    within Mal."
  To3ShortGood: Do what you think is best
  To3ShortBad: "Let\u2019s calm down"
  To3Good: "Patrick, if you think that is what you must do, I can\u2019t stop you."
  To3Bad: "Patrick, let\u2019s not do anything drastic. I will see on my end what
    I can do to rectify this. Let\u2019s just all remain calm."
  FromOverallSuccess: "Ok, I\u2019m calm now. I won\u2019t tell everyone, I\u2019ll
    see what we can do internally to fix the situation."
  FromOverallFailure: "After talking to you, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m going to tell
    the whole world about Mal\u2019s dirty little secret."
