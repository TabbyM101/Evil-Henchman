  From1: "Hi Regina, I hope you\u2019re doing good! I was just wondering when we
    were deploying our new eyewear. I think the project has real potential and could
    even take over whatever Mal Enterprise is putting out these days."
  To1ShortGood: When do you think?
  To1ShortBad: We should delay
  To1Good: Hi! We are currently refining the date for release for these new glasses.
    When do you think the roll out should happen?
  To1Bad: Oh hello. I believe we should wait and push back the release at least 6
    months.
  From2Good: I think the product is ready for market very soon. The user feedback
    has been very positive so far.
  From2Bad: "Oh really! That\u2019s a shame, the product is so good. May I ask why
    we are pushing it back?"
  To2ShortGood: Feedback has been great
  To2ShortBad: "We can\u2019t compete with Mal"
  To2Good: User feedback has been great. Great innovation like this will surely put
    us ahead of Mal Enterprises.
  To2Bad: "While user feedback has been great, I don\u2019t know if our product is
    exactly market ready. At least it can\u2019t compete with Mal."
  From3Good: "Mal has been trying to take us down for months! I\u2019m excited that
    we will finally be able to surpass them."
  From3Bad: Once again Mal is taking us down. They truly are evil, I think they even
    have spies in our own company. My manager has not shown up to work in 3 days
    after a meeting with them.
  To3ShortGood: Mal is bad
  To3ShortBad: "Mal\u2019s not that bad"
  To3Good: "You\u2019re right Mal has had it out for us. We really need to show them
    who\u2019s boss."
  To3Bad: "Look, while Mal are our competitors, they still are a company with real
    people working them. Let\u2019s really try not to demonize them."
  FromOverallSuccess: "After talking with you, I\u2019m not so sure that rolling
    out this product in the near future is such a good idea."
  FromOverallFailure: "Yay. I\u2019m ready to get us rolling on this product after
    talking with you. This is just what we need to release our product soon."
