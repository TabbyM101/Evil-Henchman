  Headline: Gregory Crocker Biography
  Content: 'Gregory Crocker, CEO of Mal Enterprises, made headlines today announcing
    that he is working on an autobiography. The book will focus on his beginnings
    in Malibu, his relationship with his father (the illustrious train tycoon), and
    his personal hardships. Crocker says this will be an exploration of him as a
    person, letting people into the suffering he had as a child due to wearing glasses
    which inspired him to create Mal in the first place. With his signature glasses
    look, he has somewhat become famous on the internet for his style and his harsh
    thoughts on work culture. He has been able to both appeal to older and younger
    generations with his strong work ethic as well as innovative ideas for the future.  '
