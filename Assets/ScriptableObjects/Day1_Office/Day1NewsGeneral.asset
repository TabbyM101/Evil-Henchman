  Headline: Tensions with Portovia
  Content: "This current administration is finding itself in hot water with the country
    of Portovia. After the president called their people \u201Cpoverty stricken welfare
    state junkies\u201D, the nation has since put embargoes on trading and promised
    more is to come. \n\nPrime Minister of Portovia, Lance Jackson, responded to
    these claims saying that the US has a higher percentage of homeless people and
    that Portovia is working on creating a stronger infrastructure for those in need
    of assistance. Jackson also includes that these remarks are a signifier that
    relations between the two countries will become much harder and promises that
    the president will not be able to sweep these comments under the rug. "
